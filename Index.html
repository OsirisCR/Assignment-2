              Venom is a character appearing in American comic books published
              by Marvel Comics. The character is a sentient alien symbiote with
              an amorphous, liquid-like form, who survives by bonding with a
              host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers
              and usually refers to itself as "Venom". The symbiote was
              originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing
              Spider-Man #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom
              in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Venom symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man himself, who
              eventually discovered its true nefarious nature and separated
              himself from the creature in The Amazing Spider-Man #258 (November
              1984)[2]—with a brief rejoining five months later in Web of
              Spider-Man #1.[3] The symbiote went on to merge with other hosts,
              beginning with Eddie Brock, its second and best-known host, with
              whom it first became Venom. Venom has endured as one of
              Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and was initially regarded
              as one of his three archenemies, alongside the Green Goblin and
              Doctor Octopus. Since his debut however, Venom has evolved into an
              antiheroic figure, slowly distancing himself from his initial goal
              to ruin Spider-Man's life to try and do good instead, even putting
              aside his differences with and helping Spider-Man at times. After
              Brock, numerous other hosts for Venom followed; some of the most
              notable are the villain Mac Gargan, who was the main incarnation
              of Venom from 2005 to 2009, and Flash Thompson, who became the
              superhero Agent Venom from 2011 to 2016, before Venom returned to
              Brock in 2017. Venom's most recent and current host is Brock's
              biological son, Dylan. Venom is also depicted as having spawned
              several children—Scream, Lasher, Phage, Agony, Riot, Mania,
              Sleeper, and most notably, Carnage, who becomes Venom's archenemy
              after being bound to serial killer Cletus Kasady.

              A fan-favorite character and well-known figure in popular culture,
              Venom (primarily the Eddie Brock incarnation) is the most
              recognizable Spider-Man antagonist not first introduced during the
              original Lee/Ditko run. He has been featured in various media
              adaptations of Spider-Man over the years, including feature films,
              television series and video games. The character was portrayed by
              Tobey Maguire and Topher Grace in Spider-Man 3 (2007), with Tom
              Hardy primarily portraying the character in the Sony's Spider-Man
              Universe films Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage
              (2021), as well as an uncredited post-credit scene appearance in
              the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).

              The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is among Spider-Man's most
              famous rogues, and is regarded by many as a dark reflection of the
              hero. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the
              character: "What started out as a replacement costume for
              Spider-Man turned into one of the Marvel web-slinger's greatest
              nightmares".[4] Venom was rated 33rd on Empire's 50 Greatest Comic
              Book Characters,[5] and ranked 22nd on IGN's 100 Greatest Comic
              Villains of All Time.[6]

            <h2>Conception and creation</h2>
            <p>
              The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later
              become the character Venom was conceived by a Marvel Comics reader
              from Norridge, Illinois named Randy Schueller.[7] In 1982, Jim
              Shooter, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, sent Schueller a
              letter acknowledging Marvel's interest in the idea, which they
              ended up purchasing from him for $220.[8] Shooter came up with the
              idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume,
              possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new
              Spider-Woman. Artists Mike Zeck and Rick Leonardi designed the
              black costume.[9][10][11]
            </p>
            <p>
              Writer/artist John Byrne says on his website that he conceived a
              costume of self-healing biological material when he was the artist
              on Iron Fist — to explain how that character's costume was
              constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next
              issue. Byrne says explaining that he ended up not using the idea
              on that title, but that Roger Stern later asked him if he could
              use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted
              the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the
              title. It was writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz who
              established that the costume was a sentient alien being that was
              vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on The Amazing
              Spider-Man that preceded Michelinie's.[12]

          With the nature of the symbiote established Michelinie felt it could
          serve a character concept he had been toying with for sometime. When
          Michelinie first began working on Spider-Man stories he noted that the
          most unique ability Spider-Man possessed as a superhero was his spider
          sense, which Michelinie claimed gave the character a level of
          invulnerability on par or better than much stronger Marvel
          superheroes. While other Spider-Man antagonists such as The Green
          Goblin and Mysterio had been able to temporarily disable Spider-Man's
          spider sense through chemical means, Michelinie was fascinated by the
          idea of a villain who could permanently evade Spider-Man's spider
          sense and what kind of consequences that would have on both Spider-Man
          as a superhero and Peter Parker's personal life. After initially
          coming up with characters who were able to evade Spider-Man's spider
          sense through cybernetic means that were rejected by Marvel editors,
          Michelinie posited that the symbiote would make a human host be able
          to evade Spider-Man's spider sense through it being mutated by
          absorbing Spider-Man's genetic material when Spider-Man was its host.
          This idea was approved by Marvel editors and Michelinie was given the
          green light to further refine the character.[13]
